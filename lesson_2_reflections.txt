What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, Git begins tracking the history of that 
	directory. You need to do it in order to use all the functionalities of Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It would make sense that you can't (or shouldn't) make changes to a 
	file in the staging area, but I seem to be doing that right now...
