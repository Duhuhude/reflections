When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I can't trust my computer to not crash, it makes sense to keep the files remote. Also, if I am not on my own computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes I want to make changes that I don't want others to see yet, or I 
	might want to remove the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one intead of another?

	A fork is a copy on Github of someone else's repository that you can work 
	on without changing theirs. It can be pushed to / pulled from. A clone is 
	a copy on a local machine, and a branch is a clone within the repository 
	itself.
