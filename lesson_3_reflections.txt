When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I can't trust my computer to not crash, it makes sense to keep the files remote. Also, if I am not on my own computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes I want to make changes that I don't want others to see yet, or I 
	might want to remove the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one intead of another?

	A fork is a copy on Github of someone else's repository that you can work 
	on without changing theirs. It can be pushed to / pulled from. A clone is 
	a copy on a local machine, and a branch is a clone within the repository 
	itself.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

	Like Sarah said, if you're not going to have internet for a while but 
	still need to work, you want the latest version of stuff to do meaningful 
	work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

	I would send files back and forth communicating every change that has been 
	made. It would be easier to make changes, because I wouldn't have to take 
	into account the changes made by others, but merging would be very 
	difficult because everyone would have very different files.
